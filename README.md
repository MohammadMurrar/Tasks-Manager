# Tasks-Manager
## COMP4310 (ANDROID) project
### In this project I developed a complete Android app that can assist users in managing their tasks.
- User can view all due tasks.
- User can add new task.
- User can change the status of the task, for example from due to done.
- Dynamic ListViews.
- All tasks persisted to local storage using Shared Preferences and GSON.
